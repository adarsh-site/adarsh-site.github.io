          <strong>Love</strong> is not a contract you sign, where you commit to telling
          everything to each other. Love is when you feel understood without
          saying a thing. When you love someone, you accept them in their
          entirety. The bad bits along with the good bits. You learn to control
          you jealousy. You put their happiness above yours. You want the best
          for them. You wish them well. You tell them things that you believe
          are your absolute truth. You share your vulnerabilities with them. You
          show them your weakest side. You bank on their compassion. You never
          expect love to be unkind. And when you lose love, it feels like you
          have lost a part of yourself. Forever. Love dies, and there is nothing
          you can do except endure the loss. It is the most painful feeling in
          the world.
        </p>

          When you are waiting to hear from someone, each minute, each second
          somehow stretches and become longer. The needles on the hands of the
          clock move slower. You obsess over the person you are waiting for. If
          only they called. If only they came home. If only you saw them. Your
          time becomes a series of '<strong>if onlys</strong>'. We seek our happiness from the
          actions of others that we have no control over. All it brings is
          expectations and then disappointments when those expectations are not
          met. How do we let go when it is the only thing that matters?   Is
          waiting for someone a sign of love? Or is it a sign of unmet
          expectations? If someone loved you truly, they would be there for you,
          no matter what. They wouldn't make you wait. If they cared for you,
          they would keep you informed. Not keep you in the dark. Love does not
          mean waiting for the phone to ring or waiting for them to appear. Love
          is the quiet knowledge that they aren't going anywhere, and will
          always be there for you.
        </p>

          Failure hurts. Failure is people judging you, and telling you that you
          are not good enough for whatever standards they have set. Failure in
          exams means you were not able to retain the information asked in the
          question paper. Does it mean you are stupid in some way? NO. But that
          exactly is the problem. Our parents, our teachers and our friends
          judge us by these failures. We absorb that subconsciously and start
          thinking our worth in terms of the marks we get, and later on by the
          money we make. If we get great marks, we are successful. If we have a
          big house, a fancy car, we are successful. If not, we are failures.  
          The real danger, however, is when we buy into all of it and begin to
          judge ourselves by these so-called failures of ours.   Don't let these
          failures define you. You are beyond that. You are much more than the
          times you have failed. You are more than the grades you are given. You
          may have failed multiple times. So what?   There are no grades given
          for how sensitive a person is. There are no grades given for how kind
          a person is, or how helpful or how funny. There are no grades for the
          degree of friendship you carefully cultivate over years, No grades for
          loving. No grades for laughing.   And yet, friendship, laughter, love,
          kindness, hope, joy, generosity - these are the most important things
          in life. And there is not a single grade to measure that.   There are
          no grades given for <strong>LIFE</strong>.

          No matter how different our parents' outlook towards life is from
          ours, the one thing we overlook is that they are always on our side.
          They try and do what is best for us. When we are very young, they
          place restrictions on us where it concerns our safety. When they think
          it endangers us, they tell us not to do certain things. 'Don't play
          with matches. Don't touch electrical wires. Don't go to the edge of
          the terrace. Don't cross the road without looking.' They repeat it so
          many times that it becomes ingrained in us. We never question these
          rules because the implications of breaking them are obvious.   But
          sometimes the implications are not so oblivous. We doubt them then.  
          I think it is okay to doubt them. In fact, it is important to question
          them. That is the only way we grow. That is the only way we grow. That
          is the only way we become adults - by weighing our opinion heavily
          against theirs and then taking a decision based on facts that are
          evident to us. Sometimes we hide these facts from our parents. We know
          that they will not understand as their perspective or world-view is
          different from ours.   All is good as long as we do not get into
          trouble, and are able to manage things on our own. But nothing's in
          our control. Things go horribly wrong. We do not know what to do. We
          turn to our parents then.   Whether we follow the rules or not, they
          are always there for us. They do the best they can in the given
          circumstances. They may scold us, reprimand us, shout at us, but
          mostly they take care of us.   If you have a set of parents who are in
          your corner, no matter what, it is a massive strength. Parents can be
          your wings when yours are broken, and you need a little help to fly.  
          With care, love and understanding, anything can heal.   Anything.

          Life is difficult. It might give you a few things. You might even be
          happy for a while, as you achieve whatever goals you set to achieve: a
          college degree, a job, a nice house, and maybe even marriage to your
          dream partner. Life keeps you busy with mundane things, and you chug
          along, happy to receive that promotion, happy to move into a bigger
          house, drive a better car, earn more money.   Eventually, life comes
          to collect. It takes away everything that means the most to you. It
          takes away your youth, and if you are not careful, your health, and
          your peace of mind too. In the course of your life, you eventually
          lose your grandparents, and then your parents. Perhaps you even lose a
          spouse or a child.   How then do you go on? What meaning can you
          derive from it all? How do you overcome the debilitating grief of
          losing all you hold dear?  Face the grief. Acknowledge it. Accept that
          it exists. Cry if you must, but limit it to ten minutes or maybe
          twenty.   After that, do things that heal your soul. Find out what
          satisfies you on a deeper level. Perhaps it is growing a beautiful
          garden, or practising music or art - or anything that you forgot in
          minutiae.   To make life more meaningful, we need to create a treasure
          trove of <strong>memories</strong> that will keep us strong. We need to find our own
          little sops that comfort us.   More then anything, we need to find
          beauty even where there is none. It exists. Always. We need to know
          where to look.

          Often we are forced to do what we do not want to do. We are forced to
          go to places we do not want to go to. We are forced to smile when we
          feel like screaming. These are social obligations we perform for the
          sake of others. We want to be accepted by others. We want to fit in.
          We want to be accepted by others. We want to be liked. We want to be
          loved. So we put our wishes aside and perform what's expected. They
          aren't big things. They are little things. <strong>Little things</strong> that bring
          joy to others.   When it comes to the big things, it is important to
          speak the truth, no matter how hard it is, how unpleasant it is. If we
          do not speak the truth in the big things, then we end up hurting
          ourselves.   The small things and the big things are what make up
          life. We need to be wise enough to make a distinction between what is
          a small thing and what is a big thing. Sometimes a small thing to us
          is a big thing to others. At other times, a big thing to us is a small
          thing to others.   If we have people in our life who treat our big
          things as their big things, and who understand how big are our small
          things to us, then we are fortunate. I think when people are on the
          same wavelength they completely get each other.   Big or small, it
          doesn't matter as long you have each other. You know that the other
          person will be there for you - to see you through the big and small
          things in life. And that you will be there for them too.   It is rare,
          but if you have it, you are blessed. If you have it, you are the
          richest person on earth.

          In a <strong>relationship</strong>, we expect others to behave the same way that we
          behave towards them. That is the biggest mistake we make. We think
          that just because we are kind and considerate, others will be the same
          towards us. We are shocked when they behave differently from how we
          expect them to. How can they do this to us, we think. We do not
          deserve this, we think. We would have never done this to them,
          right?   But perhaps we aren't stepping into their shoes. Maybe their
          yardstick for a relationship is different from ours. Maybe they have
          their own definition of love and it doesn't match ours.  
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
          The measure of what constitutes love is different for everyone. For
          some, calling once a week and talking for a while is enough expression
          of love. For others, calling once a day is adequate. Then there are
          those who like to make short calls several times a day. When it comes
          to love, there is no one-size-fits-all. Love is tailor-made for the
          one who loves. If love should thrive, communication is a must. If you
          do not communicate, love dies. Also, being busy is just an excuse when
          people do not want to keep in touch. If you really want to keep in
          touch, you will find a way. You will prioritise the other person over
          everything else. If someone wants to talk to you, they make the time,
          otherwise they make an excuse.   If someone has not kept in touch and
          you want to maintain contact with them, you should try to get back in
          touch once, or at the most twice. After that, no matter how painful it
          is, you must let go. There is no point chasing after someone who
          doesn't want to stay in you life.   Let go.   That is the best way,
          and the only way. It will hurt. But then it will hurt a tiny bit
          lesser the next day. And a little lesser the day after that.  
          Eventually it stops hurting. And we heal.   But we will always carry
          that emptiness where their love used to be. 
        </p>

          We always have a good time with our <strong>friends</strong>. But is the friendship
          good for you? There is an easy way to judge this.   One kind of
          friendship is where everyone has a good time doing something together.
          It is the shared interest that sustains the friendship. We might go to
          a restaurant together, talk about what is going on around us, gossip a
          bit, laugh a bit and then go home. We might get together, perhaps play
          a game or two, or indulge in a group avtivity everyone enjoys, eat,
          drink and then go home.   Then there is the other kind of friendship
          where you share what's closest to you heart. You talk about your plans
          for life. You trust the other person completely and believe that they
          want the best for you. They do not hesitate to tell you when you are
          wrong. They tell you things you do not want to hear, what no one else
          will tell you.   It is the second kind that makes you grow. While you
          have fun in the first one, the second one is what keeps you on track,
          on the path you have chosen. The second kind helps you to see
          clearly.   You can have the first kind of friendship with just about
          anybody who shares a few interests with you. But the second kind? That
          is harder. The challenge is to choose carefully the person for the
          second kind of friendship. If you choose the wrong person, there is a
          very real danger they will betray you. Only time will tell who is
          true.   If you have found someone who is completely trustworthy and is
          right for the second kind of friendship, then you are fortunate.   You
          have found a real treasure.
