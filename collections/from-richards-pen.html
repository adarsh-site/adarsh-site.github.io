        <strong>richard feynman’s</strong> love letter to his wife, 16 months after
        her death
      </h2>

      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          October 17, 1946 <br /> <br>

          D’Arline,<br /> <br>

          I adore you, sweetheart. <br /> <br>

          I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it
          because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over
          inside to write it to you. <br /> <br>

          It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two
          years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am,
          stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.
          <br /> <br>

          But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have
          delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to
          tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.
          <br /> <br>

          I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you
          after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you
          — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems
          to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never
          thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We
          started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or
          getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone
          without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of
          all our wild adventures. <br /> <br>

          When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something
          that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried.
          Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in
          so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can
          give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of
          loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so
          much better than anyone else alive. <br /> <br>

          I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to
          have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are
          surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart)
          after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t
          understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I
          don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all
          seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real. <br /> <br>

          My darling wife, I do adore you. <br /> <br>

          I love my wife. My wife is dead. <br /> <br>

          Rich. <br /> <br>

          PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new
          address.
